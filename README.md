# 📘 Session — A Modern Productivity & Task Management App

**Session** is a learning-focused project where I’m building a clean, modern productivity tool designed to improve my skills in **React.js**, UI/UX, and (later) full-stack development using **Node.js + Express**.

The aim is to create a Notion-inspired task manager where users can create pages, add to-dos, track progress, and view everything through a clean and intuitive interface.

Currently, I’m working on the **base UI and component structure**. Routing, backend APIs, and database integration will be added gradually.
